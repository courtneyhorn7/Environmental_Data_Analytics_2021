## LESSON OBJECTIVES

1.  Describe the purpose of using R Markdown as a communication and workflow tool
2.  Incorporate Markdown syntax into documents
3.  Communicate the process and findings of an analysis session in the style of a report

## USE OF R STUDIO & R MARKDOWN SO FAR...

1.  Write code
2.  Document that code
3.  Generate PDFs of code and its outputs
4.  Integrate with Git/GitHub for version control

## BASIC R MARKDOWN DOCUMENT STRUCTURE

1. **YAML Header** surrounded by --- on top and bottom
    + YAML templates include options for html, pdf, word, markdown, and interactive
    + More information on formatting the YAML header can be found in the cheat sheet
2. **R Code Chunks** surrounded by ``` on top and bottom
    + Create using `Cmd/Ctrl` + `Alt` + `I`
    + Can be named {r name} to facilitate navigation and autoreferencing
    + Chunk options allow for flexibility when the code runs and when the document is knitted
3. **Text** with formatting options for readability in knitted document

## THE KNITTING PROCESS
-   The knitting sequence
    ![knitting](../lessons/img/rmarkdownflow.png)

* Knitting commands in code chunks:
 - `include = FALSE` - code is run, but neither code nor results appear in knitted file
 - `echo = FALSE`    - code not included in knitted file, but results are
 - `eval = FALSE`    - code is not run in the knitted file
 - `message = FALSE` - messages do not appear in knitted file
 - `warning = FALSE` - warnings do not appear...
 - `fig.cap = "..."` - adds a caption to graphical results


## WHAT ELSE CAN R MARKDOWN DO?
See: <https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com> and class recording. 
 * Languages other than R...
 * Various outputs...

## WHY R MARKDOWN?

<Fill in our discussion below with bullet points. Use italics and bold for emphasis (hint: use the cheat sheets or `Help` →`Markdown Quick Reference` to figure out how to make bold and italic text).> 

-allows ysers to better tailor their outputs to their needs
-Rmarkdown allows you to combine paragraphs, code, and code outputs into one document --> this is very helpful for organizing
-Coded retulst are documented and can be shared. this facilitates reproducibiity and team work
-markdown is free
-can convert our RMD to pdf or word, while stata or other programs don't allow for that
-its nice that if you change your plot, all you need to do is knit the file to update changes
-you can import data and automatically update the data and everything depending on it
-you can choose to run or display just parts of the analysis. You can omit some of the intermediate steps


## TEXT EDITING CHALLENGE

Create a table below that details the example datasets we have been using in class. The first column should contain the names of the datasets and the second column should include some relevant information about the datasets. (Hint: use the cheat sheets to figure out how to make a table in Rmd)

Dataset_names | Dataset_information
--------------|---------------------
              |
ECOTOX_Neonicotinoids_Insects_Raw.csv | Data on neocotinoids and their effects on insects
EPAair_03_NC_2018(and2019).csv | Data from Air quality monitoring of and ozone
NEON_NIWO_Litter_massdata_Y-m_raw.csv | Data on Litterfall and Fine Woody Debris Sampling Data



## R CHUNK EDITING CHALLENGE

### Installing packages

Create an R chunk below that installs the package `knitr`. Instead of commenting out the code, customize the chunk options such that the code is not evaluated (i.e., not run).

```{r install knitr, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("knitr")
```



### Setup

Create an R chunk below called "setup" that checks your working directory, loads the packages `tidyverse`, `lubridate`, and `knitr`, and sets a ggplot theme. Remember that you need to disable R throwing a message, which contains a check mark that cannot be knitted.

```{r setup, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
getwd()
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(knitr)
library(rvest)
library(ggplot2)


theme_today <- theme_gray(base_size = 14) +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(color = "black"),
        legend.position = "top")

```


Load the NTL-LTER_Lake_Nutrients_Raw dataset, display the head of the dataset, and set the date column to a date format.

```{r Loading the Data, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Lake_nutrients_data <- read.csv("../Data/Raw/NTL-LTER_Lake_Nutrients_Raw.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
head(Lake_nutrients_data)
#class(Lake_nutrients_data$sampledat)
Lake_nutrients_data$sampledate <-as.Date(Lake_nutrients_data$sampledate, format = "%m/%d/%y")
class(Lake_nutrients_data$sampledate)


```


Customize the chunk options such that the code is run but is not displayed in the final document.


### Data Exploration, Wrangling, and Visualization

Create an R chunk below to create a processed dataset do the following operations:

-   Include all columns except lakeid, depth_id, and comments
-   Include only surface samples (depth = 0 m)
-   Drop rows with missing data

```{r Creating a Processed Data Set, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
colnames(Lake_nutrients_data)
Lake_nutrients_data_subset <- select(Lake_nutrients_data, lakename:sampledate, depth:po4) %>% 
    filter(depth == 0) %>% 
    drop_na()

#View(Lake_nutrients_data_subset)

```


Create a second R chunk to create a summary dataset with the mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation of total nitrogen concentrations for each lake. Create a second summary dataset that is identical except that it evaluates total phosphorus. Customize the chunk options such that the code is run but not displayed in the final document.

```{r summary data sets, echo=FALSE}
colnames(Lake_nutrients_data_subset)
View(Lake_nutrients_data_subset)

Lake_nutrients_data_subset_summary_N <- 
    Lake_nutrients_data_subset %>% 
    group_by(lakename) %>% 
    summarise(mean_N = mean(tn_ug), 
              minimum_N = min(tn_ug),
              max_N = max(tn_ug),
              sd_N = sd(tn_ug))

    
Lake_nutrients_data_subset_summary_Phos <- 
    Lake_nutrients_data_subset %>% 
    group_by(lakename) %>% 
    summarise(minimum_phos = min(tp_ug),
              max_phos = max(tp_ug),
              sd_phos = sd(tp_ug))


```


Create a third R chunk that uses the function `kable` in the knitr package to display two tables: one for the summary dataframe for total N and one for the summary dataframe of total P. Use the `caption = " "` code within that function to title your tables. Customize the chunk options such that the final table is displayed but not the code used to generate the table.

```{r tables, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

Lake_nutrients_data_subset_summary_N_named <- Lake_nutrients_data_subset_summary_N
colnames(Lake_nutrients_data_subset_summary_N_named) <- c("Lake Name", "Total Nitrogen", "Mean Nitrogen", "Minimum Nitrogen", "Maximum Nitrogen", "Standard Deviation Nitrogen") 
Lake_nutrients_data_subset_summary_Phos_named <- Lake_nutrients_data_subset_summary_Phos
colnames(Lake_nutrients_data_subset_summary_Phos_named) <- c("Lake Name", "Total Phosphorus", "Mean Phosphorus", "Minimum Phosphorus", "Maximum Phosphorus", "Standard Deviation Phosphorus")
kable(Lake_nutrients_data_subset_summary_N_named, caption = "Nitrogen Summary Table")
kable(Lake_nutrients_data_subset_summary_Phos_named, caption = "Phosphorus Summary Table")
```


Create a fourth and fifth R chunk that generates two plots (one in each chunk): one for total N over time with different colors for each lake, and one with the same setup but for total P. Decide which geom option will be appropriate for your purpose, and select a color palette that is visually pleasing and accessible. Customize the chunk options such that the final figures are displayed but not the code used to generate the figures. In addition, customize the chunk options such that the figures are aligned on the left side of the page. Lastly, add a fig.cap chunk option to add a caption (title) to your plot that will display underneath the figure.

Nitrogen Plot
```{r Nitrogen Plot, echo=FALSE, fig.align='left', fig.cap="Total Nitrogen within lakes (1991 - 2000)", message=FALSE}
#total N over time with different colors for each lake
#colnames(Lake_nutrients_data_subset)
#I wonder if I will need to put date as a factor....
#Lake_nutrients_data_subset_summary_N$total_N
#so I will be plotting a continuous numeric value over time

#ggplot(data=Lake_nutrients_data_subset, aes(x = sampledate, y = tn_ug, color = lakename)) +
  #geom_point() +
  #labs(x = "Year", y = "Total Nitrogen (tn_ug)") +
  #scales_x_continuous(breaks = c(1:8))

Nitrogen_plot <- ggplot(data=Lake_nutrients_data_subset, aes(x = sampledate, y = tn_ug, color = lakename)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1:8)) + 
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%Y", breaks = "year") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Total Nitrogen (tn_ug)")

print(Nitrogen_plot)  

#max_daily_wd_plot2 <- 
  #ggplot(daily_withdrawals_Df7, aes(x=Month, y=Max_Daily_Withdrawals)) +
  #geom_point() +
 # geom_line(color = "blue") + 
  #scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1:12),
  #labs(title = paste("2019 Water usage data for Durham"),
      #y="Withdrawal (mgd)",
     # x="Date")) 
  
#min(Lake_nutrients_data_subset$sampledate)
#max(Lake_nutrients_data_subset$sampledate)
#8 years... so maybe 8 breaks?

##errrg how to I make the figure title be in the center???


```

Phosphorus Plot
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='left', fig.cap="Total Phosphorus within lakes (1991 - 2000)", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Phosphorus_plot <- ggplot(data=Lake_nutrients_data_subset, aes(x = sampledate, y = tp_ug, color = lakename))+
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1:8)) + 
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%Y", breaks = "year") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Total Phosphorus (tp_ug)")

print(Phosphorus_plot)  
```




### Communicating results

Write a paragraph describing your findings from the R coding challenge above. This should be geared toward an educated audience but one that is not necessarily familiar with the dataset. Then insert a horizontal rule below the paragraph. Below the horizontal rule, write another paragraph describing the next steps you might take in analyzing this dataset. What questions might you be able to answer, and what analyses would you conduct to answer those questions?

I noticed from a visual inspection of my plots that the total nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations appear to differ between the lakes and the years. One thing that stood out to me was that there were high values of total Nitrogen in five of the lakes halfway through the year in 1996. These data points appear to be outliers since they stand out from the rest of the data points. Another noticeable aspect of the graphs is how East Long Lake has high values of total nitrogen and phosphorus in comparison to the other lakes each year and Tuesday Lake appears has relatively low Nitrogen values every year. 







***




One of my next steps in analysis of the data would be looking into possible causes of the high nitrogen concentrations in 1996. I predict that a stochastic environmental phenomena may have caused the unusually high nitrogen concentrations in 5 of the lakes that year. I would also like to conduct anovas to analyze whether the mean nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations of the various lakes differ from each other significantly. I hypothesize that the mean nitrogen concentrations of East Long Lake and Tuesday Lake differ significantly.

## KNIT YOUR PDF
When you have completed the above steps, try knitting your PDF to see if all of the formatting options you specified turned out as planned. This may take some troubleshooting.

## OTHER R MARKDOWN CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS

We have covered the basics in class today, but R Markdown offers many customization options. A word of caution: customizing templates will often require more interaction with LaTeX and installations on your computer, so be ready to troubleshoot issues.

Customization options for pdf output include: 

* Table of contents
* Number sections
* Control default size of figures
* Citations
* Template (more info [here](http://jianghao.wang/post/2017-12-08-rmarkdown-templates/))

pdf_document:  
    toc: true  
    number_sections: true  
    fig_height: 3  
    fig_width: 4
